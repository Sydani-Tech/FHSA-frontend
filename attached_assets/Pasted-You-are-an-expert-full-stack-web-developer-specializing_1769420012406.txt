You are an expert full-stack web developer specializing in building secure, scalable MVPs for non-profits and social impact projects. I need you to design and generate code for a cloud-based web application (MVP) for the Food and Health Systems Alliance (FHSA), an organization in Abuja, Nigeria, that helps female-led food businesses access productive assets like equipment, storage, and facilities.
The app focuses on two main user roles:

Business Users (female-led food entrepreneurs with varying digital literacy—keep UI simple, mobile-responsive, and intuitive).
Admins (FHSA staff for oversight and management).

Key principles:

Mobile-first, responsive design (use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap).
Secure and compliant with NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) and UK GDPR (e.g., encrypt PII, get consent for data, audit logs).
Scalable cloud architecture (suggest AWS/Heroku deployment).
Tech stack: Front-end in React.js (with React Router for navigation, Zustand/Redux for state), Back-end in Node.js/Express.js (RESTful APIs), Database in PostgreSQL (or MongoDB if you prefer NoSQL). Use JWT for auth, Socket.io for real-time notifications.
Integrations: Paystack for payments (handle webhooks), SendGrid/Twilio for email/SMS notifications.
Testing: Include unit tests (Jest) and E2E (Cypress).
Deployment: Dockerize for easy cloud setup.
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 (alt text, keyboard nav).
Performance: Optimize for low-connectivity areas like Abuja (lazy loading, caching).

Database Schema Outline:

Users: id, email/phone, password_hash, business_name, type (e.g., 'bakery'), location (string or geo), production_focus, capacity (optional number), certifications (array), needs (array), status (enum: pending, approved, restricted), role (enum: business_user, admin), created_at.
Assets: id, type (e.g., 'cold_storage'), location, availability (JSON schedule/array of dates), cost (decimal), duration_options (array), conditions (text), images (array URLs), specs (JSON), owner_id (optional FK), active (boolean).
Requests: id, user_id (FK), asset_id (FK), dates (daterange JSON), purpose (text), status (enum: pending, approved, rejected, completed), payment_id (FK), notes (text), feedback (JSON).
Transactions: id, request_id (FK), amount, status (enum: pending, success, failed), ref_id (string from Paystack), timestamp.
Audit_Logs: id, user_id, action (e.g., 'verify_user'), details (JSON), timestamp.

Business User Journey and Features:

Registration/Onboarding: Multi-step form (email/phone validation, business details). Save as pending. Optional fields for personalization.
Profile Verification: Display status banner. Unlock features post-approval (notify via email/in-app).
Asset Discovery/Search: Dashboard with search bar, filters (location, type, capacity). Grid/list view of asset cards (image, type, availability, cost). Detailed page with calendar, specs.
Request/Booking: Form for dates/purpose. Validate availability, submit to admin. Real-time status tracking in dashboard.
Payments: If cost applies, integrate Paystack popup. Handle success/fail states, record transactions.
Access/Usage/Completion: Show booking details, reminders (cron jobs). Post-usage feedback form.
Ongoing: Usage history, personalized recommendations, notifications for new assets.

Admin Dashboard Features:

Secure login (/admin route).
Tabs: Users (list, verify/edit/delete), Assets (CRUD with image upload), Requests (queue, approve/reject), Transactions (logs, exports), Monitoring (dashboards with charts for active users, asset utilization %, request stats).
Reporting: CSV/PDF exports for impact metrics.

Full Implementation Steps:

Set up project structure: folders for front-end (src/components, src/pages), back-end (routes, models, controllers).
Implement auth middleware (JWT login/register).
Build APIs: e.g., POST /register, GET /assets?filter=location=Abuja, POST /requests, etc.
Front-end pages: Login/Register, User Dashboard, Asset List/Detail, Request Form, Admin Panels.
Add real-time (WebSockets for notifications/updates).
Integrate payments: Paystack init and webhook endpoint.
Add security: Rate limiting, input sanitization.
Documentation: README with setup instructions, API docs (Swagger if possible).
